				<p>U.K. universities tuition fees are frequently a source of controversy, and came into limelight as the Telegraph wrote about the Russell Group “profiting from students’ misery” during the pandemic.</p> 

					The Russell Group, which consists of twenty-four universities, are public research universities in the United Kingdom. The Russell Group is the equivalent of the American Ivy League of prestigious universities, according to The Guardian. These universities are highly ranked and provide world-leading research opportunities as they are awarded two thirds of all U.K. research grants and contract income.</p> 
					
					Most universities in the U.K. offer shorter programs compared to countries such as the U.S. - three years for the average undergraduate degree instead of four, and one year for a master’s degree instead of two.</p>
					
					According to surveys, Russell Group graduates found work faster than their peers elsewhere as they were highly sought after by employers. Most universities in the U.K. are government financed. But where do you think universities get most of their income?

				<h2>The Subheading of the Income Source Part</h2>
				<img src="https://picsum.photos/640/280" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
				<p>Russell Group Universities have become more reliant on students’ payments to operate than on public spending. While funds from government bodies have also increased during the past decade, their share in the income balance has shrunk and it has been overtaken by tuition fees. In the year 2020-2021, 13 out of 24 Russell Group universities received more than 50% of their income from tuition fees.</p>
					This is a trend that the sector as a whole has seen grow since 2010, when student payments surpassed government funds for the first time, the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) said in an email. This was two years before the policy change that tripled tuition fees for domestic students from £3,000 to £9,000. Since then, the economic relevance of school fees only continued to swell to the point of accounting for more than half of universities’ income in 2016-17.</p>
					The question of who should foot the bill for higher education is still controversial. Should attending university be a mostly self-funded career choice or should taxpayers invest more in training professionals? Several studies show that tertiary education is a major driver of economic competitiveness, and the UK is in need of highly qualified labour. Last year, British employers had to recruit 239,987 professionals overseas and sponsor them using the skilled worker visa scheme— a 33% jump from 2019. </P>
					Many argue that the government has continued to chip in through student finance programmes, as a HESA spokesperson says: “Nowadays, most universities’ money comes from tuition fees but those tuition fees come often from students who then take a loan from the government to pay for them.” Only England, around 1.5 million students borrow a total of almost £20 billion every year, according to the Parliament latest figures. </p>
					“Because the student loans are government-backed and written off after 30 years, students aren’t really shouldering really as much of the cost as it may look,” says Alexis Brown, director of policy and advocacy at the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI). “The taxpayer pays for it so it’s not as quite clear cut as it would be if we were in America, where the student actually does pay it all back.” </p>
					Only one in four students who started full-time undergraduate degrees in 2020-21 is expected to repay their debt in full, according to forecasts by the Department of Education. This has resulted in the debate of who should bear the economic bulk of higher education to focus more on the design of student loans rather than the affordability of tuition fees.  </p>
					But not everyone is willing to take a loan to go to university. Even if Brown insists that student loans make it possible for everyone in the UK to go to university, the idea of having a growing debt of thousands of pounds for 30 years can be a deterrent.

        <!-- International Students -->

				<h2>International Students: The Willing Cash Cow</h2>
				<p>“All they’ve been teaching now is theoretical stuff, and they don't even talk about why we are talking about the theories. It's just quite “watery (水, with low difficulty, low value)” anyway. I never met the teacher offline for the three courses we had in the business school last semester…And the classes were just videos recorded a few years ago…It's one teacher for a few hundred students. I think it's quite unfair.” Yijing Sun, a Chinese student studying MSc Financial Economics at Cardiff University, told us.</p>

				<p>But Like many other international students, she’s willing to choose to come to the UK for her education. “I think it was worth the money. Because when I first came here, I didn't intend to learn anything, after all, you don't learn much in a year. I believe the main thing is to get some experience.” </p>

				<p>The number of students paying international tuition fees (non-EU international students enrolled before 2022), at the 24 Russell Group universities is rising sharply between the financial year ending 2017 and 2021, with 16 universities experiencing an increase of more than 20%, including the University of Glasgow, which has seen a 100.6% increase in non-EU international students. This is closely followed by Queen's University Belfast, which has seen an 81.2% increase. </p>

				<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1498429"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

				<p>And these increases were not driven solely by growth in total student numbers, as 21 of them also saw increases in the ratio of non-EU international students numbers to total student numbers. And among these, UCL and the University of Glasgow rose by almost 0.1, which means that for every 10 students, there is 1 more student paying international tuition fees and 1 less student paying local tuition fees. In terms of percentage increase of the ratio, the highest is at Queen's University Belfast at 70%, followed by Glasgow University at 55%.</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1498527"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

				<p>In its Spending Review 2021, the Russell Group says that "income from international student fees" is "a key area of university activity which generates a surplus". This claim is supported by the Office for Students (OfS) ' The Transparent Approach to Costing (TRAC) 2019-20 Report. Its figures show that while universities across the UK made huge deficits in public-funded teaching and research that year, "Non-publicly funded teaching (primarily overseas students) continued to generate a significant surplus" of 2.32billion.</p>

				<p>Another report mentioned by Spending Review 2021 also supports the fact of its reliance on international student fee income. For home-fee students, they "estimate that across the sector deficits average £1,940 per student per year". And “even the most inexpensive classroom-based subjects face deficits of £1,000 per student”.</p>

				<p>They say these figures are based on the Development of the OfS's approach to funding published in September 2020 and other data. The paper states that FTE students (Home and EU full-time equivalent students) are causing deficits in five different price groups of education programs. However, only one of these price groups has an average annual cost of over £12,000, and unlike the average home student tuition fee, which is under £9,000, international students' fees are well above this level, typically starting at 20,000 a year, making it a lucrative deal. And this is how they had “been doing more with less” since 2015, as a spokesperson for Universities UK suggested in an interview with the Guardian.</p>

				<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9899872"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

				<p>The growth of international students is only possible if the school is willing to recruit, but also if the students are willing to come. In the academic year 2020-2021 (which corresponds to the financial year ending 2021), the largest number of international students coming to the UK are from China at 99,160, followed by the European Union at 66,680 and India in third place at 53,015. The number of students from the EU has remained stable. However, compared to the 2016-2017 academic year, the number of students from China has increased by 48% and the number of students from India has jumped by 430%.</p>

				<p>The quality of education is high, the reputation is high, the length of study is short and the total cost is low compared to other English speaking countries such as North America. These are the reasons why large numbers of new middle-class Chinese and Indian students come to study in the UK. However, one of the reasons they come to the UK to attend university may come as a surprise - it is much less difficult to gain admission.</p>

				<p>China and India are the top two countries in the world in terms of population, quality education resources per capita are inevitably scarce. Entrance exams like Common Admission Test (CAT), IIT-JEE (Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination), Gaokao (China National College Entrance Examination) and Kaoyan (exam to select postgraduates in China), among others, keep getting tougher to crack for students applying in their universities. The number of candidate seats remains the same, while the number of applicants exponentially increases with every passing year. The admissions process for prestigious government universities, in particular, is made more difficult due to the rigorous pattern of the entrance exams.</p>

				<p>As Mengyang Li, a Chinese student studying MA History at the University of Exeter told us “...and as long as you pass the application, you don't have to take exams under pressure like in China.” And Yijing Sun said “The reason was very realistic. I was too lazy to work on the exams to go to graduate school in China.”</p>

				<p>Student agencies further take the hassle out of the application process for potential international students. Both Chinese students interviewed said they paid 10,000 RMB, or about £1,200 or more, for their services. However, there are many agents who do not charge students and make their profits from the commissions given to them by UK universities. "It's usually 15-25% of the tuition fee," an owner of one such agency, who declined to reveal her personal details, told us. This statement coincides with an article published by HEPI.</p>

				<p>For this, we sent FOIs to all 24 Russell Group universities, requesting data on which student agencies they work with and how much they pay in commissions to these student agents. Of these, Oxbridge and Imperial said they do not use student agencies for recruitment, and LSE said it had recruited only 14 students through this channel in the 2020-21 academic year. A further 19 universities said in different ways that "in a highly competitive business environment, publishing this data would put them at a competitive disadvantage" and declined to disclose the figures. </p>

				<p>Only the University of York gave us a meaningful response, “The total spend on external recruitment agencies for the 2020/1 financial year was £8,742,094.” </p>

				<p>And the money, for the Universities, was well spent.

				<h2>The Subheading of the Surplus Part</h2>
				<img src="https://picsum.photos/640/280" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
				<p>The Operating surplus of universities has always been a contentious subject. As universities have charitable organisation status, they are exempt from paying tax, however, due to this, they are non-profit organisations. Operating surplus is defined as total income minus total expenditure and is therefore essentially profit under a different name. We calculated the Operating Surplus of all Russel group universities using data from the HESA and found in 2020 they amassed (£2,531,400) and in 2021 (£1,074,438) as shown in fig 1. </p>
                <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9897905"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
					It is no surprise that the Russel group has come under fire lately for their reported total surplus. The Telegraph’s article titled ‘Russell Group universities “profiting from students” misery’ after amassing £2.2bn cash surplus’, suggests throughout the covid-19 pandemic, Russel group universities have done little in the way of supporting students despite evidently having the financial means to do so. There was no Russel group-wide refunding of tuition fees, alleviation of accommodation costs or bursaries given to students during this time despite an industry-wide reduction in face-to-face teaching. In response to the Telegraph’s article, a Russell Group spokesperson stated universities had “worked hard to prioritise students and provide the best possible experience during the pandemic”—including by investing significantly in digital learning and increasing wider support services.” As well as Russel group surplus demonstrating their strong financial position Fig 2 demonstrates that in the financial year-end 2020-21 staff costs were down from previous years. Equally, figure 2 shows that total expenditure was reduced for the same financial year, likely contributing to the huge operating and total surplus seen. This income and expenditure pattern brings into question the universities teaching provisions during the pandemic. </p>

					In the 2021 Student Academic Experience Survey, published by the Higher Education Policy Institute “Forty-four per cent of students report ‘poor or very poor’ value – a significant leap from the 29% of students with that perception in 2019”. So it is clear that many students did not feel online teaching was a valuable use of their tuition fees. In a Guardian article Andreas Schleicher, director of education and skills for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development stated “I don’t think you can ask students to pay £9,000 for just online lessons.” Scheicher further stated a continuation of online learning post-pandemic would “erode public support for tuition fees of up to £9,259”. In an interview, Andrew Norton, a professor in the Practice of Higher Education Policy at the Australian National University argued “demand for higher education is really not as sensitive to the economic incentives, as you might expect”, and while there is often short term reductions in demand for higher education when changes such as increases in tuition fees occur. The Demand for higher education tends to resume “this very long term trend towards greater participation in our education”. It is safe to assume a similar trend in spite of the type of education provided to students. Whether these factors will reduce numbers of university applicants is up for contention but it is evident that the majority of students prefer to receive in-person teaching. While during the pandemic universities had little choice but to provide students with online classes, they should have at least refunded students a portion of their tuition fees, a sentiment echoed in a telegraph article by Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the education select committee, stating, “The higher education regulator should work with universities to ensure “students get the money back they deserve”.

		          <b>
					Q: What made you choose to study in the U.K. rather than your home country? Why did you choose the UK out of many other countries for education?</b>

					<p>A: What can I say? The reason was very realistic. I was too lazy to work on the exams to go to graduate school in China. I lost the enthusiasm for studying after undergraduate study. Relatively speaking, coming to the UK is good value for money. Especially for girls, there is an age problem. Also, I like to watch English dramas. Hahaha. And at the time, Australia won’t let me in.</p>

					<b>Q: What about Hong Kong and New Zealand, did you not consider these options?</b>

					<p>A: Singapore was so competitive. And I didn't consider Asia as I needed to go far away from home when studying abroad.</p>

					<b>Q: Did you apply for university by yourself or through an agent? How much did you pay?</b>

					<p>A: Agent. I think it was less than 20,000 RMB (2,431 GBP). I paid my first agent 12,000 RMB. The second one was over 8,000 RMB. I went to two because the first one was a piece of trash. The first agent kept brainwashing me, saying that my grades weren't good enough, so I couldn't apply to good schools. I almost got brainwashed. They applied to a school which doesn't even accept my university’s degree and made me submit the application and pay the fee. </p>

					<p>Agencies usually make five applications to UK universities for you. They get the money if you get into any of them. And they don’t even consider if they are applicable. They just apply what you said. It's very frustrating.</p>

					<b>Q: Do you think it was worth the money?</b>

					<p>A: In hindsight, I think what the agent was doing was making money from the information gap, so for me at that time, I thought it was worth it. OK, I think it is also worth it now, because after all, I don't know a lot of information and I was afraid I would make a mistake and miss out on a good school offer.</p>

					<b>Q: So where did you get your tuition fees from?</b>

					<p>A: From my family.</p>

					<b>Q: How is your experience here? Is it different from what you thought it would be? Do you think it is worth the money?</b>

					<p>A: I think my experience here has been okay. I don't think there was any difference. I think it was worth the money. Because when I first came here, I didn't intend to learn anything, after all, you don't learn much in a year. I believe the main thing is to get some experience.</p>

					<p>All they’ve been teaching now is theoretical stuff, and they don't even talk about why we are talking about the theories. And everything you learn now is just for exams. I feel like it's the same as in China. It's just quite “watery (水, with low difficulty, low value)” anyway. I never met the teacher offline for the three courses we had in the business school last semester. Most of the students who came to the business school didn't speak English very well, they weren't native speakers, and the teachers had accents, and the classes were just videos recorded a few years ago. If you are not too diligent, you won't watch it. </p>

					<p>The question and answer session is also the same, one person only has one hour, and there are so many people in a class. There is not enough time and no one asks questions either, so it's pretty “watery” anyway.</p>

					<b>Q: Actually, tuition fees are the most important part of Russell Group universities' income apart from Oxbridge, and international students' tuition fees are the biggest part of it. It is calculated that only international students who pay high tuition fees generate income for the university, while every student who pays domestic tuition fees loses money. Do you think it's reasonable to pay so much more money?</b>

					<p>A: I think it's unreasonable. They may think that for people from other countries to come and enjoy quality education in my country, you have to pay so much. But I now feel that this “quality education” is in inverted commas. And the only impact the Russell Group has had on me so far is that when doing my thesis the tutor I chose was shared with the Russell Group, but it didn't make much difference because it was all online anyway and I couldn't communicate with the tutor offline. Some programs have a very good allocation of resources. They have one teacher for two students. But for us, it's one teacher for a few hundred students. I think it's quite unfair.

				<h2>Andrew Norton</h2>
				<img src="https://picsum.photos/640/280" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
				<b>Our research findings from the Higher Education Statistics Agency demonstrate that university income has become more reliant on tuition fees in the UK than ever before. For example - In 2020-2021, 13 out of 24 Russell Group universities received more than 50% of their income from tuition fees.
					Do you have any insight on why this might be?</b>
					
					<p>I think there's two reasons, One is about a decade ago England abolished subsidies for most undergraduate courses and switched to the 9 thousand pound model so that meant the fee income from English students went up significantly. Over this same time period, with the exception of a dip during covid, the number of international students in the UK has gone up and they typically pay much higher fees than the local students. And so that has a big effect on the overall share of university revenue that is coming from tuition fees So I think they're both domestic and international factors here. </p>
					
					<b>Is it a similar picture in Australia?</b>
					
					<p>It's broadly similar the big difference is that in Australia the tuition subsidies, even though they're now quite small in some fields, have never been abolished, and so they are still playing a larger role in the Australian system than the English system……. Thats the main reason Australia has, I think, been a little bit different to the UK in that regard. And there's no move here [australia] to get rid of the tuition subsidies entirely so I think that’ll be a fairly stable feature of the Australian system. </p>
					
					<b>So, as you said international, students have become an increasingly leaned on income source, for, it seems all universities. And in the Uk at least, often we find this is because domestic students' fees are capped, whereas international students’ fees are not. 
					First of all, do you know the extent to which they have been growing over the past few years in terms of the global picture?</b>
					
					<p>They’ve been growing, at least in all the English speaking countries, except for [during] covid, heavily driven by China and India, to less extent Latin America. And so this is driven in part by growing middle classes in countries that haven't historically had high higher education participation rates.
