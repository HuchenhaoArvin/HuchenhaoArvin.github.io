				<p>(the intro)The Russell Group universities, which consists of twenty-four universities, are public
					research universities in the United Kingdom. The Russell Group is the equivalent of the American Ivy
					League of prestigious universities, according to The Guardian. These universities are highly ranked
					and provide world-leading research opportunities as they are awarded two thirds of all U.K. research
					grants and contract income. According to surveys, Russell Group graduates found work faster than
					their peers elsewhere as they were highly sought after by employers. Most universities in the U.K.
					are government financed. But where do you think universities get most of their income?</p>

				<p>when they started being more relevant than the government's money? Have they increased? People

					Russell Group Universities have become more reliant on students' payments to operate than on
					public spending. While funds from government bodies have also increased during the past decade,
					their share in the income balance has shrunk and it has been overtaken by tuition fees. In the
					year 2020-2021, 13 out of 24 Russell Group universities received more than 50% of their income
					from tuition fees.

				<h2>The Subheading of the International Students Part</h2>
				<img src="https://picsum.photos/640/280" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
				<p>(according to HESA)The number of students paying international tuition fees, which means all
					non-EU international students enrolled before 2022, at the 24 Russell Group universities is
					rising sharply between 2017 and 2021, with 16 universities experiencing an increase of more
					than 20%, including the University of Glasgow, which has seen a 100.6% increase in non-EU
					international students. This is closely followed by Queen's University Belfast, which has
					seen an 81.2% increase. </p>

					And these increases were not driven solely by growth in total student numbers, as 21 of them
					also saw increases in the number of non-EU international students as a percentage of total
					student numbers. And among these, UCL and the University of Glasgow rose by almost 10 percentage
					points, which generates a 20% difference between the proportion of students paying home tuition
					fees and the proportion of students paying home tuition fees.</p>
					<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/7825215"></div>
					In its Spending Review 2021, the Russell Group says that "income from international student
					fees" is "a key area of university activity which generates a surplus". This claim is supported
					by the Office for Students (OfS) ' The Transparent Approach to Costing (TRAC) 2019-20 Report.
					Its figures show that while universities across the UK made huge deficits in public-funded
					teaching and research that year, "Non-publicly funded teaching (primarily overseas students)
					continued to generate a significant surplus" of 2.32billion.</p>

					Another report mentioned by Spending Review 2021 also supports the fact of its reliance on
					international student fee income. For home-fee students, they "estimate that across the sector
					deficits average £1,940 per student per year". And “even the most inexpensive classroom-based
					subjects face deficits of £1,000 per student”.</p>

					They say these figures are based on the Development of the OfS's approach to funding published
					in September 2020 and other data. The paper states that FTE students (Home and EU full-time
					equivalent students) are causing deficits in five different price groups of education programs.
					However, only one of these price groups has an average annual cost of over £12,000, and unlike
					the average home student tuition fee, which is under £9,000, international students' fees are
					well above this level, typically starting at 20,000 a year, making it a lucrative deal.

				<p>as charities, are unis allowed to have surplus? What do they do with it? Have they been
					getting more? What SHOULD they do with it? Include an interview from simon. Is this
					surplus ethical? Especially in the Covid context (where we see the highest surplus).
					Where has the 2020 surplus come from? (see pivot table 3 in HESA data) </p>
				<p>The Operating surplus of universities has always been a contentious subject. As
					universities have charitable organisation status, they are exempt from paying tax,
					however, due to this, they are non-profit organisations. Operating surplus is defined as
					total income minus total expenditure and is therefore essentially profit under a
					different name. We calculated the Operating Surplus of all Russel group universities
					using data from the HESA and found in 2020 they amassed (XXX) and in 2021 (£££) as shown
					in fig 1. It is no surprise that the Russel group has come under fire lately for their
					reported surplus. The Telegraph’s article titled ‘Russell Group universities “profiting
					from students” misery’ after amassing £2.2bn cash surplus’, suggests throughout the
					covid-19 pandemic, Russel group universities have done little in the way of supporting
					students despite evidently having the financial means to do so. There was no Russel
					group-wide refunding of tuition fees, alleviation of accommodation costs or bursaries
					given to students during this time despite an industry-wide reduction in face-to-face
					teaching.
