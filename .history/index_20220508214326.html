				<p>U.K. universities tuition fees are frequently a source of controversy, and came into limelight as the Telegraph wrote about the Russell Group “profiting from students’ misery” during the pandemic.</p> 

					The Russell Group, which consists of twenty-four universities, are public research universities in the United Kingdom. The Russell Group is the equivalent of the American Ivy League of prestigious universities, according to The Guardian. These universities are highly ranked and provide world-leading research opportunities as they are awarded two thirds of all U.K. research grants and contract income.</p> 
					
					Most universities in the U.K. offer shorter programs compared to countries such as the U.S. - three years for the average undergraduate degree instead of four, and one year for a master’s degree instead of two.</p>
					
					According to surveys, Russell Group graduates found work faster than their peers elsewhere as they were highly sought after by employers. Most universities in the U.K. are government financed. But where do you think universities get most of their income?

				<h2>The Subheading of the Income Source Part</h2>
				<img src="https://picsum.photos/640/280" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
				<p>Russell Group Universities have become more reliant on students’ payments to operate than on public spending. While funds from government bodies have also increased during the past decade, their share in the income balance has shrunk and it has been overtaken by tuition fees. In the year 2020-2021, 13 out of 24 Russell Group universities received more than 50% of their income from tuition fees.</p>
					This is a trend that the sector as a whole has seen grow since 2010, when student payments surpassed government funds for the first time, the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) said in an email. This was two years before the policy change that tripled tuition fees for domestic students from £3,000 to £9,000. Since then, the economic relevance of school fees only continued to swell to the point of accounting for more than half of universities’ income in 2016-17.</p>
					The question of who should foot the bill for higher education is still controversial. Should attending university be a mostly self-funded career choice or should taxpayers invest more in training professionals? Several studies show that tertiary education is a major driver of economic competitiveness, and the UK is in need of highly qualified labour. Last year, British employers had to recruit 239,987 professionals overseas and sponsor them using the skilled worker visa scheme— a 33% jump from 2019. </P>
					Many argue that the government has continued to chip in through student finance programmes, as a HESA spokesperson says: “Nowadays, most universities’ money comes from tuition fees but those tuition fees come often from students who then take a loan from the government to pay for them.” Only England, around 1.5 million students borrow a total of almost £20 billion every year, according to the Parliament latest figures. </p>
					“Because the student loans are government-backed and written off after 30 years, students aren’t really shouldering really as much of the cost as it may look,” says Alexis Brown, director of policy and advocacy at the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI). “The taxpayer pays for it so it’s not as quite clear cut as it would be if we were in America, where the student actually does pay it all back.” </p>
					Only one in four students who started full-time undergraduate degrees in 2020-21 is expected to repay their debt in full, according to forecasts by the Department of Education. This has resulted in the debate of who should bear the economic bulk of higher education to focus more on the design of student loans rather than the affordability of tuition fees.  </p>
					But not everyone is willing to take a loan to go to university. Even if Brown insists that student loans make it possible for everyone in the UK to go to university, the idea of having a growing debt of thousands of pounds for 30 years can be a deterrent.

				<h2>The Subheading of the International Students Part</h2>
				<img src="https://picsum.photos/640/280" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
				<p>(according to HESA)The number of students paying international tuition fees, which means all
					non-EU international students enrolled before 2022, at the 24 Russell Group universities is
					rising sharply between 2017 and 2021, with 16 universities experiencing an increase of more
					than 20%, including the University of Glasgow, which has seen a 100.6% increase in non-EU
					international students. This is closely followed by Queen's University Belfast, which has
					seen an 81.2% increase. </p>

					And these increases were not driven solely by growth in total student numbers, as 21 of them
					also saw increases in the number of non-EU international students as a percentage of total
					student numbers. And among these, UCL and the University of Glasgow rose by almost 10 percentage
					points, which generates a 20% difference between the proportion of students paying home tuition
					fees and the proportion of students paying home tuition fees.</p>
					<!-- <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/7825215"></div> -->
					In its Spending Review 2021, the Russell Group says that "income from international student
					fees" is "a key area of university activity which generates a surplus". This claim is supported
					by the Office for Students (OfS) ' The Transparent Approach to Costing (TRAC) 2019-20 Report.
					Its figures show that while universities across the UK made huge deficits in public-funded
					teaching and research that year, "Non-publicly funded teaching (primarily overseas students)
					continued to generate a significant surplus" of 2.32billion.</p>

					Another report mentioned by Spending Review 2021 also supports the fact of its reliance on
					international student fee income. For home-fee students, they "estimate that across the sector
					deficits average £1,940 per student per year". And “even the most inexpensive classroom-based
					subjects face deficits of £1,000 per student”.</p>

					They say these figures are based on the Development of the OfS's approach to funding published
					in September 2020 and other data. The paper states that FTE students (Home and EU full-time
					equivalent students) are causing deficits in five different price groups of education programs.
					However, only one of these price groups has an average annual cost of over £12,000, and unlike
					the average home student tuition fee, which is under £9,000, international students' fees are
					well above this level, typically starting at 20,000 a year, making it a lucrative deal.

				<h2>The Subheading of the Surplus Part</h2>
				<img src="https://picsum.photos/640/280" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
				<p>The Operating surplus of universities has always been a contentious subject. As universities have charitable organisation status, they are exempt from paying tax, however, due to this, they are non-profit organisations. Operating surplus is defined as total income minus total expenditure and is therefore essentially profit under a different name. We calculated the Operating Surplus of all Russel group universities using data from the HESA and found in 2020 they amassed (£2,531,400) and in 2021 (£1,074,438) as shown in fig 1. </p>

					It is no surprise that the Russel group has come under fire lately for their reported total surplus. The Telegraph’s article titled ‘Russell Group universities “profiting from students” misery’ after amassing £2.2bn cash surplus’, suggests throughout the covid-19 pandemic, Russel group universities have done little in the way of supporting students despite evidently having the financial means to do so. There was no Russel group-wide refunding of tuition fees, alleviation of accommodation costs or bursaries given to students during this time despite an industry-wide reduction in face-to-face teaching. In response to the Telegraph’s article, a Russell Group spokesperson stated universities had “worked hard to prioritise students and provide the best possible experience during the pandemic”—including by investing significantly in digital learning and increasing wider support services.” As well as Russel group surplus demonstrating their strong financial position Fig 2 demonstrates that in the financial year-end 2020-21 staff costs were down from previous years. Equally, figure 2 shows that total expenditure was reduced for the same financial year, likely contributing to the huge operating and total surplus seen. This income and expenditure pattern brings into question the universities teaching provisions during the pandemic. </p>
					
					In the 2021 Student Academic Experience Survey, published by the Higher Education Policy Institute “Forty-four per cent of students report ‘poor or very poor’ value – a significant leap from the 29% of students with that perception in 2019”. So it is clear that many students did not feel online teaching was a valuable use of their tuition fees. In a Guardian article Andreas Schleicher, director of education and skills for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development stated “I don’t think you can ask students to pay £9,000 for just online lessons.” Scheicher further stated a continuation of online learning post-pandemic would “erode public support for tuition fees of up to £9,259”. In an interview, Andrew Norton, a professor in the Practice of Higher Education Policy at the Australian National University argued “demand for higher education is really not as sensitive to the economic incentives, as you might expect”, and while there is often short term reductions in demand for higher education when changes such as increases in tuition fees occur. The Demand for higher education tends to resume “this very long term trend towards greater participation in our education”. It is safe to assume a similar trend in spite of the type of education provided to students. Whether these factors will reduce numbers of university applicants is up for contention but it is evident that the majority of students prefer to receive in-person teaching. While during the pandemic universities had little choice but to provide students with online classes, they should have at least refunded students a portion of their tuition fees, a sentiment echoed in a telegraph article by Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the education select committee, stating, “The higher education regulator should work with universities to ensure “students get the money back they deserve”.
